Budget,"This is a financial estimate to show how much money a person or an organization will earn and how much they will need or be able to spend in a year. The term “Budget” is derived from Bougette which is a French word meaning
Purse. It generally refers to a list of all proposed incomes and expenses of the government. Under Article 202(1) of the Constitution of India, a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditure of the state has to be laid before the legislature
in respect of every financial year. This statement is known as “Annual Financial Statement” (AFS) or popularly known as Budget. In the Indian federation, the Government has two layers. The Central Government presents its budget on the last day of February every year. However, the State Governments adhere to no such fixed date. Recently there is an attempt to have uniform Budget system for all the third tiers of the Local Government in the country. The Budget of a State Government is generally presented before the Legislative Assembly in the last
week of February or the first week or March every year."
